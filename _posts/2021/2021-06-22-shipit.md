Ship early and ship often. This is a principle we embrace and celebrate here at [A Serious Business, Inc.](https://www.aseriousbusiness.com/). It's a cultural holdover [from our days at GitHub](https://github.blog/2012-09-24-how-we-ship-github-for-windows/)...

> At GitHub, we ship a lot. We think itâ€™s so important to ship often, we even have a shipping mascot and matching emoji (`:shipit:`).

The shipping mascot mentioned in the post is the famous Shipit Squirrel!

![Shipit Squirrel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/122805857-796f9480-d27e-11eb-8ee8-ccb335d14f23.png).

The shipit squirrel showed up everywhere. If a Pull Request was ready to go, we'd comment on the PR with the :shipit: emoji. In chat, we had a [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) script we could call that posted a random shipit squirrel into the chat room. The [hubot-shipit](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-shipit) script still lives on! It's a nice way to encourage each other.

With [Abbot](https://ab.bot/), it's possible to build such a skill without any code as Abbot has first-class support for building skills that pull a random item from a list via the `list` skill. The following is a demonstration:

```
@abbot list add shipit
@abbot shipit add https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/122805857-796f9480-d27e-11eb-8ee8-ccb335d14f23.png
```

That first command creates a new custom list named `shipit`. The second command adds an image URL to the new list.

With this in place, you can call the `shipit` skill with no arguments (`@abbot shipit`) to tell it to retrieve a random item from the list. In this case, with only one item, that's not so interesting. So lets add more items to the list like so:

```
@abbot shipit add https://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lybw63nzPp1r5bvcto1_500.jpg
@abbot shipit add https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/122805749-55ac4e80-d27e-11eb-9ec5-ea5cd551a9a2.png
```

The next time you run `@abbot shipit`, Abbot will return a random item from the `shipit` list.

Hopefully your teammates will use such lists responsibly, but just in case someone adds an image that is not conducive to a culture of shipping, you can log in to [the Abbot List Skills page](https://ab.bot/lists) to find out who added which items.

By my estimate 80% of Hubot scripts that GitHub employees wrote for internal user were variations of this theme. For example, I mentioned that a previous co-worker wrote `.haack me` which brought up a [random animated gif of me](http://haacked.com/archive/2016/04/28/thank-you/). Turns out, that co-worker is now my co-founder.

We use custom lists for fun and to build camaraderie. For example, the default `joke` skill is implemented as a custom list. We also have a Magic 8 Ball custom list. But we also use them for real work such as tracking ideas for new skills. What interesting lists will you create?
