Today marks [Shana's](https://twitter.com/sh4na) first day as an Abboteer (yes, we're going to try and make that term a thing) joining us all the way from Portugal! Shana is known for diving deep into a challenge. She enjoys gaming, diving, and redefining which way is up.

We worked together at [GitHub](https://github.com/) where we learned just how talented and formidable an engineer she is. We couldn't be more excited that she's our first hire!

She will be starting as a Founding Software Engineer to help us to take Abbot to the next level. Help us welcome Shana to A Serious Business, Inc!
