Andrew joins us from GitHub where they worked on the Identity team. Prior to GitHub, I worked with Andrew at Microsoft on ASP.NET Core where they contributed to the first versions of Razor, MVC, and NuGet. Way back in the day, Andrew was a core contributor to the popular DotNetNuke open source project.

Andrew will lend their expertise in .NET Core to help make Abbot even better! Join us in welcoming Andrew to A Serious Business!
