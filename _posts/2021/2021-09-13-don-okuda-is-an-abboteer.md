We’re excited to share that Don Okuda has joined us as a Founding Product Designer to help make Abbot even more enjoyable to use. 

![Don escaped so he could join us](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/279389/133121368-3e40bb9d-c3c1-4046-89b8-4e00d6e90b78.jpg)

We all worked with Don at GitHub on GitHub Desktop and can’t wait to work with him more here. 

When he’s not making great products, Don makes music and cooks his SPAM medium rare. 

Don insists he’s an actual human, so please join us in welcoming him to A Serious Business!
