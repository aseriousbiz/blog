We’re excited to share that @niik and @joshaber have put Don back in the dryer and Don will be delivered back to GitHub ASAP.

![Mad Don](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13760/133258348-41e83378-fb4d-4e3c-9ec3-4167a25b0522.png)

We all worked with Don at GitHub on GitHub Desktop and can’t wait for him to go back to working on it!

When he’s not making great products, Don makes music and enjoys pineapple on his pizza.

Don insists he’s an actual human, so please join us in welcoming him back to GitHub!
